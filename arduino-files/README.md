# Useage Notes


- Collect data using the IMU_Capture file, copy the serial output & put it into separate CSV files.
- While collecting data try and visualize it using the serial plotter as it will help you visualize how different your data is for different interactions.
- Once data is collected use this colab notebook to train your interactions. [Colab notebook link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sandeepmistry/aimldevfest-workshop-2019/blob/master/arduino_tinyml_workshop.ipynb)
- Download the header file and replace the one in "arduino-gesture-serial" folder. Update the file based on your classifiers and number of interactions.
- Test it out on the serial monitor and then let your creativity fly I guess.


### I promise to write better documentation by spring break with more projects and experimentations so that you can follow it better.
