# Punch punch revolution

### Notes for Noah
- The serial-web folder has the code components which I presented with in the winter show.

From machine learning models requiring a massive computational power to run, we went to have them run in browsers. Now smaller versions of the models can be run in Arduinos which are smaller than 2 inches. An experiment which extends the question, what happens when we move beyond human-machine interaction to a point where we are part human & part machine.

To put this existential question to a mild ease the first experiment is a simple exercise game where people practice punching with assistance of machine learning. The microprocessor classifies hand movements into different types of punches such as ‘jab’, ‘hook’ & ‘uppercut’.

More documentation coming soon...
